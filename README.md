# Project Overview

This project consists in coding an incomplete test suite for a web-based application that reads RSS feed. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was included. 

## How to use it
Visit this link or download/clone this repository and open the file 'index.html'. You will see the results from the test here. If you want to test something else, just add your suite to the feedreader.js file in the Jasmine folder.
